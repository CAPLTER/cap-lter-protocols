# CAP LTER particle size analysis protocol
adapted by Hannah Heavenrich 2017

This method is taken from: Gee, G.W., and J.W. Bauder 1986. Particle size analysis. p. 383-411. *In*: A. Klute (ed.) Methods of soil analysis, part 1. Physical and Mineralogical Methods. 2nd ed. Agron. Monogr. 9 ASA and SSSA, Madison, WI. (2ed edition). The method here will separate the sand, silt, and clay fractions. Additional hydrometer readings can be taken if greater discrimination within the size fractions is desired (see Gee and Bauder 1986). 

I. Equipment and Reagents

1. Hydrometer, ASTM no. 152 H with Bouyoucos scale in g L^-1^.
2. Large Reciprocal Shaker
3. Metal dispersing cups (for milk shake machines)
4. 500 ml Nalgene bottles
5. Plunger for sedimentation cylinders. (A long rod with a perforated disk attached to the bottom)
6. Sedimentation cylinders with 1 L mark.
7. Amyl alcohol (only if there is excess foam after shaking)
8. Sodium metaphosphate solution, 50 g/ L^-1^.
9. 2 mm (no. 10) mesh sieve
10. Rolling pin and large rubber stopper (no. 10 to 14 works well)
11. Drying oven, weighing pans
12. Scale accurate to 0.1 g
13. Distilled water
14. Thermometer

II Procedure

1. Sample preparation

A. Place samples out on a bench or table to air dry for one week. It is best to break up structures in samples that are high in clay as these can become very hard upon drying.

B. When the sample is dry it may be necessary to *gently* crush the
structures with a rubber stopper or mortal & pestal. 

C. Pass the sample through a 2 mm sieve. A rubber stopper makes a good device to break up and push through soil structures. Be sure that only gentle pressure is applied, too much pressure will distort the sieve mesh.

2. Analysis

**Soil Dispersion**

A. Weigh a sample for analysis into a 500 mL Nalgene bottle. If the soil is fine textured, silty or clayey use about 50 g. If the soil is coarse textured use about 75 g.

B. Weigh about 10 g into a small weighing pan to determine a soil moisture correction factor. Place in oven and dry at 105^o^C for 24 h. (This step has been completed for the entire 200-point survey.)

C. Add 250 mL of distilled water and 100 mL of Sodium MetaPhosphate solution to the sample in the Nalgene bottle. Place bottles in the reciprocal shaker and turn on ‘low’ setting for 24 hours.

So 50g/L \* 0.1L = 5g of SMP in the solution

\^As per equipment list above

D. Quantitatively transfer the suspension to a 1000 mL settling
cylinder and bring the volume to 1000 mL.

5 g/L or 0.005 g/ml (aka g/cm^3^)

**Hydrometer Measurements**

A. Allow time for the mixture to equilibrate thermally (10 min is
sufficient) and record temperature.

B. Insert the plunger and while holding the bottom of the cylinder, mix the solution thoroughly. Stirring should be done with rapid upstrokes and gentle downstokes such that all the sediments are dislodged from the bottom of the cylinder. Mix in this fashion for about 5 to 10 seconds, finish with two or three slow smooth strokes. 

C. When mixing is completed, insert the hydrometer slowly into the solution and take a reading (at the *top* of the meniscus)at 0.5 min and 1 min. Record as R~0.5~ and R~1~. Read to the nearest 0.5 g. Rinse and dry the hydrometer between samples. Record temperature after the R~1~ reading.

D. Take a hydrometer reading at 90 min and 1440 min (24 h). Record as

R~90~ and R~1440~. Record the temperature at the time of each reading.

E. Prepare a blank solution (100 mL HMP, 900 mL distilled water, no soil) and read and the record the temperature at the same times as the soil solution above. Record as R~L0.5~, R~L1~, R~L90~, and R~L1440~.

3. Calculations

**Clay Fraction**

A. Use the 90 min and 1440 min readings (both R and R~L~ values)

B. Compute the mean particle size diameter (in m) in suspension (X) and the summation percentage (P) for the 90 and 1440 min readings. Use the equations below:

X = θ*t*^-½^

Where *t* is time (in minutes) and θ is the sedimentation parameter and is a function of hydrometer settling depth, solution viscosity, particle density and solution density.

Therefore: θ = X*t*^-½^

The sedimentation parameter, X, can be determined as follows:

X = 1000\*(B*h*′)^½^

Where:

* B=30 \*η/\[g(*ρs* - *ρl*)\]
* η = solution viscosity in poise, g cm^-1^s^-1^ (i.e. of HMP not just
* water (η~o~))
* (viscosity of H~2~O^†^ at ^o^C \*1.02125)
* η = η~o~ (1+4.25\*\[HMP\]) with \[HMP\] in g/cm^3^
* η = η~o~ (1+4.25\*\[0.05\])
* η = η~o~ 1.02125
* Where η~o~ = 0.01 (km/m/s) at 20°C and 0.0089(km/m/s) at 25°C
* *h*′ = effective hydrometer depth, cm (-0.164R+16.3)
* R is the uncorrected hydrometer reading. This assumes ASTM 152H hydrometer and standard sedimentation cylinder. (*There is a formula to calculate h′ for other hydrometers and cylinders).*
* g = gravitational constant, cm s^-2^ (980 cm s^-2^ )
* ρs = soil particle density, g cm^-3^ (2.65 g cm^-3^)
* ρl = solution density, g cm^-3^ (density of H~2~O^†^ at ^o^C\*1.00315)
* ρl = ρ~o~(1+0.630\*\[HMP\])
* ρl = ρ~o~(1+0.630\*\[0.05\])
* ρl = ρ~o~\*(1.00315)
    + Where ρ~o~ = 0.998 at 20°C and 0.997 at 25°C

^†^ This can be obtained form the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics

The summation percentage for a given time interval can be determined as follows:

P = (C/C~o~)\*100

Where:

* C = concentration of soil in suspension in g L^-1^ (determined C = R – R~L~)
* R = hydrometer reading of sample
* R~L~ = hydrometer reading in blank (R and R~L~ taken at each time interval)
* C~o~ = oven dry weight of the sample

C. Compute the summation percentage at 2 *u*m. This is determined from the equation below: (This is the percent clay)

P~2*u*m~ = *m* ln (2/X~1440~) + P~1440~

Where:

* *m* = (P~90~ – P~1440~)/ln(X~90~/X~1440~)
* X~1440~ = mean particle diameter in suspension at 1440 min
* P~1440~ = summation percentage at 1440 min
* X~90~ = mean particle diameter in suspension at 90 min
* P~1440~ = summation percentage at 90 min

**Sand Fraction**

Compute the 50 *u*m summation percentage using the same procedure as above, but using 0.5 and 1 min hydrometer readings. The equation for summation percentage at 50 *u*m differs as follows: (note the bold)

P~50*u*m~ = 100- (*m* ln (**50**/X~1~) + P~1~)

P~50*u*m~ would be everything remaining in suspension smaller than 50
µm (i.e. silt + clay).

**Silt Fraction**

Determine the silt fraction by subtraction as follows:

% silt = 100 - (% sand + % clay)

Comments

Assuming weighing of the samples is accurate, two sources of error exist:

1. Flocculation of clays by soluble salts or gypsum during sedimentation. This can be dealt with in two ways. a) Increasing the concentration of HMP to levels high enough to maintain dispersion (be sure to use same solution in blank), and b) treatment with an acid most commonly 1 *M* HCl adding enough so the sample is acidified to pH 3.5 to 4.0. I would recommend increasing the concentration of HMP first since this is less troublesome than working with HCl.
2. Hydrometer reading can be a major source of error. Studies have shown that a 1% error in reading will result in a 2% error in clay calculations. (Read at the top of the meniscus since capillary action wicks the H~2~O up the hydrometer stem)

**Soil Moisture Correction Factor**

Typically, air dry soil is used for analysis as oven drying can change the nutrient content of a soil by volatilizing nutrients, or causing changes in shape of clay humus particles. Results of soil analyses are expressed on an oven dry basis as soil moisture changes with time. When analysis is performed on a soil that will have results expressed a dry weight, a soil moisture correction factor (smcf) must be calculated on a subsample.

Procedure

The weight of the sample should be about 10 grams and should be taken at the time you weigh the samples intended for analysis. The smcf should be taken from the bulk sample in such a way as to be representative of the bulk sample. This means avoid the edges of the container or stray chunks of soil which are of a differing moisture content that the bulk sample. Samples are usually dried for 24 hours at 105^o^C.

After removal of the smcf sample from the drying oven, place in a desiccators for about 30 to 60 minutes. This will prevent the sample from adsorbing moisture from the air as it cools.  The smcf is calculated as follows:

smcf = (dry weight/moist weight)

(where dry weight is the oven dry weight of the soil dried for 24 hours at 105 ^o^C)

To convert the moist soil weight in your lab analysis to dry weight:

Dry Weight = (Moist weight)(smcf)

The formula for smcf is a modification of the formula for percent dry matter.
