**Soil Sampling**

1. Samples for chemical analyses (Nitrogen, Carbon, moisture content, soil organic matter content). Sample soil 10 meter from the plot center at North, East, South, and West four directions using 1 inch diameter, 12 inch deep slam hammer soil cores. Retrieve the plastic liner from metal core and cap both ends. Use Blue cap for Bottom end and red for the upper end. 
    + Note: if sample point is paved or not safe to sample soil, move to the nearest possible position; record the sample position on the field sheet and with the GPS.
2. Samples for pH, bulk density and texture determination. One meter north from the center, use 2 inch diameter, 6 inch long slam hammer soil core to take *one intact* soil core for bulk density analysis. \[Note: you **must obtain an intact core** so you can get both the soil weight and soil volume.\]

**Soil Processing and Analyses**

A. *Initial preparation and determination of soil moisture and organic
matter content.*

1. Combine soils collected in four cores from the same plot but separate them into 0-10 cm top-soil section and 10-30 bottom-soil section. Process and analyze two sections separately since they can be very different regarding soil chemistries. Record the weight of top soil and bottom soil (hint: you may not get a full 30 cm core, thus you should measure soil height to get the exact volume). Sieve soil through 2 mm sieve and keep sieved soil in plastic bags.
2. Weigh sub-samples of soil into aluminum pan, record both pan weight and soil weight. Dry soil in 60 C oven for 48 hours. (This was done while weighing out FW soil for KCl extraction).
3. Cool down soil in dry desiccator (\~ 30 minutes), weigh Pan + Dry soil.
4. Ash dry soil in 550 C muffle furnace for 2 hours, leave the samples in the furnace overnight. Put ashed soil samples in 60 C oven for 48 hours, weigh soil as described above.

B. *Processing soil for bulk density and particle analyses*

1. Record the height of 2 inch diameter core and total fresh soil weight.
2. Transfer ALL soil into aluminum tray and air dry soil for a week.
3. Sieve soil through 2 mm sieve, return unpassed portion to aluminum tray and use rubber stop to crush attached soil particles, sieve soil again.
4. Weigh both sieved portion (soil) and particles can not pass the sieve (&gt; 2 mm portion, or stone portion). 
5. Weigh sub-sample of soil into aluminum weighing pan and dry at 60 C oven.
6. Record oven dry weight (60 C) as described above.
7. Put weighed pan with soil into 105 C oven for 24 hour, record soil
 oven weight (105 C).
8. Calculate total soil dry weight (sieved soil plus unsieved portion).
9. Calculate bulk density (g/cm3) using total soil weight and soil
 volume data.
10. Protocol for soil particle analysis still under development by Doug  Green & Diane Hope.

C. *Determining soil nitrogen (extractable NO~3~-N and NH~4~-N) content*

1. For sieved soil, weigh \~ 10g fresh weight (FW) soil into 250 ml bottles, add 50 ml 2M KCl solution, shake at high speed for 1 hour on reciprocating shaker, let it settle for one hour, and filter soil slurry through ashed GF/A paper (see below for ashing method), using Falcon 7102 filter (from Fisher) unit.
2. Pour the filtrate into 60 ml bottles, acidify it with 0.2 ml 6 N HCl and refrigerate.
3. Analyze KCl solution in autoanalyzer and determine NH4 and NO3 concentrations in mg N/L.
4. Preparation of chemical solutions:
    + i. 2 M KCl: Weigh 150 g KCl, dissolve in \~ 750 ml Nanopore water, bring the water level to 1 L level. Or dissolve 600 g KCl in \~ 3 L water and bring the final water level to 4 L mark.
    + ii. 6 N HCl: Mix 50 ml concentrated HCl with 50 ml nanopore water with caution, add acid into water, NOT vise versa! Store in 120 ml Nalgene bottle.
    + iii. Prepare all standards using the same extraction solution (2M KCl, acidified, for example). Add 5 ml 6N HCl to 1 L 2M KCl to get acidified KCl solution for standard preparation.

D. *Calculations*:

Soil % Moisture Content (calculated as g H~2~O held by 100g DW soil) = (Fresh soil weight – Dry soil weight)/Dry soil weight x 100%.

% Soil organic matter = (Soil DW before ashing – DW after ashing) / Soil DW before ashing x 100%.

Dry Soil/Fresh Soil Ratio = Dry soil weight/Fresh soil weight

Dry soil weight used for KCl extraction = Fresh soil weight used for KCl extraction x Dry/Fresh ratio

Soil Extractable N (mg N/kg DW soil) = N concentrations in KCl solution (mg/L) x 50 (volume of KCl used for extraction) / Soil Dry weight used for extraction
